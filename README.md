## Introduction
Tuya Gateway Networking SDK is a software middleware. It can directly establish communication links with Tuya Cloud and Tuya APP by means of the networking capabilities of the device, and carry out Tuya standard data interaction. Users use this SDK to develop gateway products connected to Tuya Cloud.
- Gateway products
    The gateway networking SDK and different protocol controllers are used to make the product into a physical gateway product, and the gateway is connected to various products with different communication protocols, such as: Zigbee, BLE, ZWAVE, etc. For example: common control centers and smart hosts in smart homes. The gateway provides gateway firmware, gateway controller, and firmware upgrade capabilities for sub-terminal devices.

- Gateway and equipment products
    In addition to the control of gateway devices for sub-devices, it also serves as a device product to define the function points of the device and realize the control of the gateway device.
